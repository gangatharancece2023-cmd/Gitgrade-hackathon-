Repository Mirror is an AI-powered system designed to evaluate a student’s GitHub repository and present an objective view of their coding skills. The system takes a public GitHub repository URL as input, automatically analyzes repository structure, documentation quality, commit history, and overall project consistency. Based on multiple evaluation dimensions, it generates a meaningful score, a concise written summary, and a personalized improvement roadmap. Acting like an AI coding mentor, the solution provides honest and actionable feedback that helps students understand their strengths and areas for improvement. This project can assist recruiters, mentors, and learners in assessing real-world coding ability effectively.
